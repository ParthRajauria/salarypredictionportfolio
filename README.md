Salary Prediction Project (Python)
## Objective
In this Project, We build a model to predict salaries for the job postings contained in test_features.csv. To achieve this, we examine the set of job postings with salaries contained in train_features.csv & train_salaries.csv and learned our model on this. 

## Discover the Data
We first Examined our Data using Exploratory Data Analysis and performed Feature Visualization on all features along with statistical analysis among features to get the cleaner data.

## Developed Solution
I tried various algorithms suitable for this type of regression problem. I Included 3 main algorithms (Ridge Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoostRegressor) and buld model on them, out of these the best one is picked as the final model.

We also developed the best possible MultiLayer Perceptron model on this dataset using Tensorflow and Keras. We reduced the mean squared error to 356.83.

## Future Work
* I would like to work more on Feature Engineering part to create better features from existing feature to build better models.
