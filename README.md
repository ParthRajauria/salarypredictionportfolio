Salary Prediction Project (Python)
## Objective
In this Project, My Task is to build a model to predict salaries for the job postings contained in test_features.csv. To achieve this, we examine the set of job postings with salaries contained in train_features.csv & train_salaries.csv and learned our model on this. 

## Discover the Data
We first Examined our Data using Exploratory Data Analysis and performed Feature Visualization on all features along with statistical analysis among features to get the cleaner data.

## Developed Solution
I tried various algorithms suitable for this type of regression problem. I Included 3 main algorithms (Ridge Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoostRegressor) and buld model on them, out of these the best one is picked as the final model.

## Things to Improve
* I would like to work more on Feature Engineering part to create better features from existing feature to build better models.
* I will also implement a neural network to get the better model with least mean squared error.
